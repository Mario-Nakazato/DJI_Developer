# Project for Comparing Coverage Path Planning Techniques for UAVs

This repository contains the code and implementations used in the **project comparing Boustrophedon cellular decomposition and spanning tree coverage** techniques applied to coverage path planning for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the efficiency of different coverage approaches in mapping missions, using the **DJI Mobile SDK** and **Firebase**.

## Application Demo

To watch the application demo, visit the video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x-V-9HLa1Ws).

## Project Objective

The project aims to perform a **comparative analysis** between two commonly used coverage path planning techniques for UAV mapping:

- **Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition (BCD)**
- **Spanning Tree Coverage (STC)**

The analysis focuses on metrics such as **distance traveled**, **number of photos captured**, **number of turns made**, and **execution time**, both in simulated environments and real-world scenarios using the **DJI Mavic Pro** drone.

## Implemented Features

- **Autonomous Missions**: Implementation of flight missions using DJI drones, with BCD and STC coverage techniques.
- **Data Collection**: Logging data such as flight paths, captured images, and mission performance.
- **Simulation and Real Execution**: Flight path planning tests in simulated environments and with real drones.
- **Firebase Integration**: Data storage locally and in the cloud for real-time analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **DJI Mobile SDK 4.17**: Used for autonomous flight control and data capture.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Used for storing flight data and images.
- **Android Studio**: Development environment with integrated tools for version control (Git) and mobile interface development.

## Preliminary Results

During the tests, the following characteristics were observed:

- The BCD method covered slightly longer distances but performed better in terms of **execution time**.
- The STC method captured more photos but required more **turns**, leading to longer execution times in some scenarios.
- Both methods showed **similar efficiency** in total coverage.

## Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your Android project to integrate the DJI SDK:

```groovy
implementation 'com.dji:dji-sdk:4.17'
provided 'com.dji:dji-sdk-provided:4.17'
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Open the terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:
     ```
     git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd repository_name
     ```

2. **Configuration of the `local.properties` File**

   - The `local.properties` file is automatically generated by Android Studio. There is no need to modify it manually, but you should ensure that the following keys are present:
     ```
     sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\Notebook\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
     MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
     DJI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
     ```
   - **Note**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your respective API keys. The keys are necessary to access the mapping services and the DJI SDK.

3. **Installing Dependencies**

   - Open the project in Android Studio.
   - Wait while Android Studio synchronizes the project and downloads the necessary dependencies. If there are any issues, check the `build.gradle` file and make the necessary corrections.

4. **Run the Project**

   - Connect an Android device to your computer or start an Android emulator.
   - Select the device or emulator in the Android Studio toolbar.
   - Click the **Run** button (or press `Shift + F10`) to compile and run the application.

5. **Verification and Testing**

   - After installation, open the application on the device.
   - Ensure that the mapping functionality and DJI features are working correctly.

### Final Considerations

- **Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation of DJI and Google Maps for additional information on the APIs used.
- **Common Errors**: If you encounter errors during execution, check if the API keys are correct and if the necessary permissions are granted on the device.
